Our app uses a databse that was created using mySQL, the connectivity the the database require a username and a password,
the one that were used are Username: root and Password: pokemon12, the sql files have been provided with the code files.

To start the app run the NewJFrame java file and enter one of the following username and password:
Username:     Password:
-karim        pokemon
-jamil        a140312h
-atef         fransa

or enter a new username and password of your own and press the register button then the login button

Note: when creating a new file, spereate the name of members, admins and spectators with a spaces like so: karim jamil atef
